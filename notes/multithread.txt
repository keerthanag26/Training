Multithreading 
	process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.

Advantages of Java Multithreading
1) It doesn't block the user because threads are independent and you can perform multiple operations at the same time.

2) You can perform many operations together, so it saves time.

3) Threads are independent, so it doesn't affect other threads if an exception occurs in a single thread.


Life cycle of a Thread

In Java, a thread always exists in any one of the following states.

New

Blocked / Waiting
Timed Waiting
Terminated

- New State   
- Runnable State  ->  start() method
- Running State     -> a thead is running with run() method 
- Waiting State	    -> sleep(),  wait() method

From Running, Runnable state to dead state through stop() method.
