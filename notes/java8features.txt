Java 8 features:

	Lambda Expressions
	Functional Interfaces
	Method Reference
	Streams
	Comparable and Comparator
	Optional Class
	Date/Time API

Lambda Expressions
• Lambda is equivalent to a function (method) without a name. 
• Lambda’s are also referred as Anonymous functions. 
	• Method parameters 
	• Method Body 
	• Return Type 
• Lambdas are not tied to any class like a regular method. 
• Lambda can also be assigned to variable and passed around.

Syntax of the Lambda Expression

Lambda Expression: 
( )		 	->		 			{ } 
Lambda 		Arrow Lambda		Body 
input 
Parameters

Why we use Lambda Expression?

	To provide the implementation of Functional interface.
	Less coding.
	
Functional Interface
Lambda expression provides implementation of functional interface. An interface which has only one abstract method is called functional interface. Java provides an anotation @FunctionalInterface, which is used to declare an interface as functional interface.


Method Reference

 
Syntax of Method Reference

	ClassName::instance-methodName 
	ClassName::static-methodName 
	Instance::methodName

Where to use Method Reference?

• Lambda expressions referring to a method directly. 

Using Lambda: 
toUpperCaseLambda = (s)->s.toUpperCase(); 

Using Method Reference:
toUpperCaseMethodRefernce = String::toUpperCase;

Stream 

What is a Stream ?

• Stream is a sequence of elements which can be created out of a collections such as List or Arrays or any kind of I/O resources and etc., 
	List<String> names = Arrays.asList("adam","dan","jenny");
	names.stream(); // creates a stream
• Stream operations can be performed either sequentially or parallel. 
	names.parallelStream(); // creates a parallel stream
• Main purpose is to perform some Operation on Collections. 
• Parallel operations are easy to perform with Streams API without having to spawn a multiple threads. 
• Streams API can be also used with arrays or any kind of I/O.

intermediate operator

map()
filter()

terminator operator

reduce()
collect()
forEach()

distinct() , count() and sorted() limit()

• distinct – Returns a stream with unique elements 
• count – Returns a long with the total no of elements in the Stream. 
• sorted - Sort the elements in the stream

sum() 
max() 
min() 
average()

Optional Class

• Avoids Null Pointer Exception and Unnecessary Null Checks.
