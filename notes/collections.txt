A map is a collection of pairs of objects:
	1. A value: this is the object to be stored.
	2. A key: this is another object associated with the value, and which can be
	used to quickly find the value within the collection.
	A map is really a set of keys, with each each key
	having a value attached to it.
	Maps do not allow duplicate keys.
