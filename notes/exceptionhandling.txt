Exception

An expectation is an unexpected event that occurs while executing the program, that disturbs the normal flow of the code.

Java Exception Hierarchy

	Throwable –
	It is the root class for the exception hierarchy in java. 
	It is in the java.lang package.
	
	Exception –
	Subclass of Throwable.
	Consist of abnormal conditions that can be handled explicitly.
	If one handles the exception then our code will continue to execute smoothly.
	
	Error –
	Subclass of Throwable.
	Eg: StackOverFlowError that can happen in infinite loop or recursion
	
TYPES OF EXCEPTION IN JAVA

	Checked Exceptions - checked at compile-time
	They are child classes of Exception except for RuntimeException.
	Example: IOException, ClassNotFoundException, etc.
	
	Unchecked Exceptions - checked at runtime
	They are child classes of RuntimeException.
	They give runtime errors if not handled explicitly.
	Example: ArithmeticException, NullPointerException etc

Java Exception Keywords
Exception Handling in java is managed via five keywords: 
try, catch, throw, throws, and finally. 

KEYWORD	 
try		This keyword is used to specify a block and this block must be followed by either catch or finally. That is, we can’t use try block alone.
catch	This keyword must be preceded by a try block to handle the exception and can be followed by a final block later.
finally	This keyword is used to execute the program, whether an exception is handled or not.
throw	This keyword is used to throw an exception.
throws	This keyword is used to declare exceptions.


Java Custom Exception
You can create your own exception and give implementation as to how it should behave. Your exception will behave like a child’s class of Exception.

Syntax: class YourException extends Exception{}
