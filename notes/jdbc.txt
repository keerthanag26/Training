JDBC

JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity. JDBC is a Java API to connect and execute the query with the database.
the steps to connect to a database in java

	Registering the driver class
	Creating connection
	Creating statement
	Executing queries
	Closing connection

What are the JDBC API components?

The java.sql package contains interfaces and classes for JDBC API.

 

Interfaces:

	Connection
	Statement
	PreparedStatement
	ResultSet
	ResultSetMetaData
	DatabaseMetaData
	CallableStatement etc.

Classes:

	DriverManager
	Blob
	Clob
	Types
	SQLException etc.
 

We can use JDBC API to handle database using Java program and can perform the following activities: 

Connect to the database

Execute queries and update statements to the database

Retrieve the result received from the database.

What is the difference between execute, executeQuery, executeUpdate?

Statement execute(String query) is used to execute any SQL query and it returns TRUE if the result is an ResultSet such as running Select queries. The output is FALSE when there is no ResultSet object such as running Insert or Update queries. We can use getResultSet() to get the ResultSet and getUpdateCount() method to retrieve the update count. 

Statement executeQuery(String query) is used to execute Select queries and returns the ResultSet. ResultSet returned is never null even if there are no records matching the query. When executing select queries we should use executeQuery method so that if someone tries to execute insert/update statement it will throw java.sql.SQLException with message “executeQuery method can not be used for update”.

Statement executeUpdate(String query) is used to execute Insert/Update/Delete (DML) statements or DDL statements that returns nothing. The output is int and equals to the row count for SQL Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements. For DDL statements, the output is 0. 


You should use execute() method only when you are not sure about the type of statement else use executeQuery or executeUpdate method.
 

What do you understand by JDBC Statements?

JDBC statements are basically the statements which are used to send SQL commands to the database and retrieve data back from the database. Various methods like execute(), executeUpdate(), executeQuery, etc. are provided by JDBC to interact with the database.
 

JDBC supports 3 types of statements:

Statement: Used for general purpose access to the database and executes a static SQL query at runtime.

PreparedStatement: Used to provide input parameters to the query during execution.

CallableStatement: Used to access the database stored procedures and helps in accepting runtime parameters..
